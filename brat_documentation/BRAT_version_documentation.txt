Most recent update v1.0.1

v1.0.1
    -fixed an issue where alternate residues would not be recognized if the
        identification was done using numbers in the pdb file.

v1.0.0
    -established as first stable version

v0.1.5
    -added the ability to handle pdb files without a chain ID. BRAT in this case
        assumes that there is only one chain for all of the ATOM entries in the 
        alignment. Any user binding residue input should also lack the chain (if it's
        the query missing the chain ID). This can be done in pdb format by having the 
        same chain ID in the mini pdb as is the query pdb (both = ' '). This can be
        done in csv by having each residue of form:

            <3 letter chain ID><chain><residue number>, ...
            where chain is equal to ' '. 

            for example: 
            for no chain ID it should look like "ASP 200" 
            for chain ID A is should look like "ASPA200"
    -added the ability to prompt the user whenever a binding residue in a csv is of format
        <3 letter chain ID><residue number> saying that it is not proper format
        and that it will be ignored. This, however, will cause the alignment to 
        not output properly so I commented out the normal prompt and replaced it with a 
        message describing to the user that the output will not be correct unless the 
        binding residues are of normal format.


v0.1.4
    -added the ability to handle insertions in the pdb file that follow the format:
        <residue> <chain> <res_num><insertion_letter>
        TYR A   24A
        LEU A   24B
    -added a Datestamp to both the output brat_res.csv and brat_aligned.html files
    -added an error message if a binding residue from the user input csv is not of form: 
        <3 char residue ID><chain><resnumber>
    -added the file path for the query and target to both the output brat_res.csv and 
        brat_aligned.html files
    -added corresponding residues of the target to the brat_res.csv output file directly under 
        the query binding residues.


v0.1.3

    -added the ability to handle mutated residues that are a part of the protein.
        BRAT can handle the following mutated residues:

        TPO = PHOSPHOTHREONINE, PTR = PHOSPHOTYROSINE, SEP = PHOSPHOSERINE, 2ML = 2-METHYLLEUCINE, 
        M3L = N-TRIMETHYLLYSINE, MLY = N-DIMETHYL-LYSINE, ACE = ACETYL GROUP, 
        LMQ = (3S)-3-METHYL-L-GLUTAMINE, MEQ = N5-METHYLGLUTAMINE, NCY = N-METHYLCYSTEINE, 
        HIC = METHYL-HISTIDINE], AGM = 5-METHYLARGININE, 2MR = N3,N4-DIMETHYLARGININE, 
        SME = METHIONINE SULFOXIDE


v0.1.2

    -removed the emphasis on heavy atoms for the ligand. All ligand atoms
        will now be taken into account for the ligand radius used to gather
        BRAT binding residues.
    -fixed an issue where the binding residue input as a csv file would not 
        work if spaces were included in the file.


v0.1.1

    -added ability to handle multiple chain alignments
    -added the ability to handle a range of residue numbers as a ligand
