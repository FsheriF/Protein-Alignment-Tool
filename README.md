Protein Alignment Tool by Joseph Buffington-Bemister, created in the PSA-Lab.

BRAT shows key residue (e.g., ligand-binding) correspondences between sequence-divergent homologs aligned by structural superposition.  

BAT displays residues and their numeric properties (from the B-value column) of PDB structures, given their structural superposition
