Protein Alignment Tool by Joseph Buffington-Bemister, created in the PSA-Lab.

[BRAT](https://github.com/psa-lab/Protein-Alignment-Tool/blob/master/brat.py) shows key residue (e.g., ligand-binding) correspondences between sequence-divergent homologs aligned by structural superposition.  

[BAT](bat_code) displays residues and their numeric properties (from the B-value column) of PDB structures, given their structural superposition
